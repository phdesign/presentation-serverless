# Going Serverless: Code Without Infrastructure

A [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) presentation.

## Summary
Write and deploy code without worrying about compilation, networks, infrastructure and servers. Is it too good to be true? In this talk we'll examine serverless architecture (especially on AWS) and why there's so much hype about it at the moment.

## Developing

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Runs a local webserver at http://localhost:8080.

## Building

```
$ npm run build
```

Outputs compiled files to 'dist' folder.

## Deploying

```
$ npm run deploy
```

Pushes final assets to gh-pages branch on GitHub.
